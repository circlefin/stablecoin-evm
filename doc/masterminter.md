# MasterMinter contract

The MasterMinter is a governance contract. It delegates the functionality of the
`masterMinter` role in the Circle FiatToken contract to multiple addresses. (The
`masterMinter` role can add and remove minters from a FiatToken and set their
allowances.) The MasterMinter contract delegates the minter management
capability to `controllers`. Each `controller` manages exactly one `minter`, and
a single `minter` may be managed by multiple `controllers`. This allows
separation of duties (offline key management) and simplifies nonce management
for warm transactions.

Minters and FiatToken holders are not affected by replacing a `masterMinter`
user address with a `MasterMinter` contract.

# Roles

The `MasterMinter` contract has the following roles:

- `owner` - adds and removes controllers, sets the address of the
  `minterManager`, and sets the owner.
- `minterManager` - address of a contract (e.g. USDC) with a
  `MinterManagementInterface`. The `minterManager` contract stores information
  about minter allowances and which minters are enabled/disabled.
- `controller` - each controller manages exactly one minter. A controller can
  enable/disable its minter, and modify the minting allowance by calling
  functions on the `MasterMinter` contract, and `MasterMinter` will call the
  appropriate functions on the `minterManager`.
- `minter` - each `minter` is managed by one or more `controller`. The `minter`
  cannot perform any actions on the MasterMinter contract. It interacts only
  with the FiatToken contract.

# Interaction with FiatToken contract

The `owner` of the FiatToken contract can set the `masterMinter` role to point
to the address of the `MasterMinter` contract. This enables the `MasterMinter`
contract to call minter management functions on the FiatToken contract:

- `configureMinter(minter, allowance)` - Enables the `minter` and sets its
  minting allowance.
- `removeMinter(minter)` - Disables the `minter` and sets its minting allowance
  to 0.
- `isMinter(minter)` - Returns `true` if the `minter` is enabled, and `false`
  otherwise.
- `minterAllowance(minter)` - Returns the minting allowance of the `minter`.

Together, these four functions are defined as the `MinterManagementInterface`.
The `MasterMinter` contains the address of a `minterManager` that implements the
`MinterManagementInterface`. The `MasterMinter` interacts with the FiatToken
contract via the `minterManager`.

When a `controller` calls a function on `MasterMinter`, the `MasterMinter` will
call the appropriate function on the `FiatToken` contract on its behalf. Both
the `MasterMinter` and the `FiatToken` do their own access control.

# Function Summary

- `configureController(controller, minter)` - The owner assigns the controller
  to manage the minter. This allows the `controller` to call `configureMinter`,
  `incrementMinterAllowance` and `removeMinter`. Note:
  `configureController(controller, 0x00)` is forbidden because it has the effect
  of removing the controller.
- `removeController(controller)` - The owner disables the controller by setting
  its `minter` to `0x00`.
- `setMinterManager(minterManager)` - The owner sets a new contract to the
  `minterManager` address. This has no effect on the old `minterManager`
  contract. If the new `minterManager` does not implement the
  `MinterManagementInterface` or does not give this instance of the
  `MasterMinter` contract permission to call minter management functions then
  the `controller` calls to `configureMinter`, `incrementMinterAllowance`, and
  `removeMinter` will throw.
- `configureMinter(allowance)` - A controller enables its minter and sets its
  allowance. The `MasterMinter` contract will call the `minterManager` contract
  on the `controller`'s behalf.
- `incrementMinterAllowance` - A controller increments the allowance of an
  <b>enabled</b> minter (`incrementMinterAllowance` will throw if the `minter`
  is disabled). The `MasterMinter` contract will call the `minterManager`
  contract on the `controller`'s behalf.
- `removeMinter` - A controller disables a `minter`. The `MasterMinter` contract
  will call the `minterManager` contract on the `controller`'s behalf.

# Deployment

The `MasterMinter` may be deployed independently of the `FiatToken` contract
(e.g. USDC).

- <b>FiatToken</b> then <b>MasterMinter.</b> Deploy `MasterMinter` and set the
  `minterManager` to point to the `FiatToken` in the constructor. Then use the
  `MasterMinter` `owner` role to configure at least one `controller` for each
  existing `minter` in the `FiatToken`. Once the `MasterMinter` is fully
  configured, use the `FiatToken` `owner` role to broadcast an
  `updateMasterMinter` transaction setting `masterMinter` role to the
  `MasterMinter` contract address.
- <b>MasterMinter</b> then <b>FiatToken.</b> Deploy `MasterMinter` and set the
  `minterManager` to point to address `0x00` in the constructor. Then deploy the
  `FiatToken` and set the `masterMinter` to be the address of the `MasterMinter`
  contract in the constructor. Next, use the `MasterMinter` `owner` to set the
  `minterManager` and configure `controllers`.

# Configuring the MasterMinter

We recommend assigning at least <b>two</b> `controllers` to each `minter`.

- <b>AllowanceController.</b> Use this `controller` to enable the `minter` with
  a single `configureMinter` transaction, and then use it exclusively to sign
  `incrementMinterAllowance` transactions. There may be multiple
  `AllowanceControllers` that sign different size allowance increment
  transactions.
- <b>SecurityController.</b> Use this `controller` to sign a single
  `removeMinter` transaction and store it for emergencies.

This configuration allows the `removeMinter` transaction to be presigned as
nonces for the `SecurityController` are deterministic, which reduces the time to
respond when there's an issue. Broadcasting the `removeMinter` transaction will
cause all future interactions from the `AllowanceController` to `throw`.

# MasterMinter vs. MintController

Creating a `MasterMinter` contract that _inherits_ from a `MintController`
contract with no changes may seem like a curious design choice. This leaves open
the possibility of creating other contracts that inherit from `MintController`
without creating naming confusion due to their different functionality.
